store-bookmarks
===============

This is a project of my own experiment.  I would like to learn more about the new Javascript MVC framework out there and picked AngularJS as it looks pretty good.  The code in side is a work-in-progress.  However, I also have the intension for this project to be usable.  Enough so that I would like to use it to use it as my own.
